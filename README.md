# How to run the software
In order to run this software, you need to have python3. 
1. Download the code from the repository. 
2. Using the command line, navigate to the project folder and run the following command: ```python3 main.py```

## Limitations (My Capabilities Only)
1. Tkinter does not seem to be working as intended on macOS, so if possible, run this software on Windows/Linux. 
2. Limitation of capability 1 and 4: requires manual reloading of the tabs when room status is change on a different tab. (can be done with the reload button)
3. Limitation of capability 4: must hit confirm button after all checkboxes for a certain room in order to change the room's status to "Available"
4. Limitation of capability 4: every time this tab is reloaded, forgets checkboxes that were left previously checked (it either all boxes must be checked or nothing happens)
